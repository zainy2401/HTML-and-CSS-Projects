## One Page Website
This one page website is a minimally styled project, it is about a car rental company that showcases its rental options, prices and a form to contact them. The website makes use of a simple collection of links to navigate the web page with some images, a table, embedded video and a contact form.
## Space Station Site
This project is made about a space travel company and uses more advanced CSS styling for the basic components such as in the navbar, images with overlays, grids and a custom contact form.
